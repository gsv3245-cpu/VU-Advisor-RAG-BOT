# VU AI Academic Advisor (DATA308)

Author: Ganga Sagar Verma

## Project overview

This project is a retrieval-augmented academic advisor built for Vidyashilp University’s B.Tech (Data Science) programme. It helps students and advisors answer curriculum-related questions using official academic data, university policy documents, and structured course records instead of guesswork.

The system is designed to answer questions about:
- semester-wise course plans and batch progression
- credits, L-T-P structure, prerequisites, electives, and baskets
- minor requirements and eligibility
- academic calendar and policy rules from the Student Handbook and SOP
- conflicts or missing information when the source data is unclear or inconsistent

Every answer is grounded in source material and cites the exact data source, sheet cell, or handbook page. The assistant can ask follow-up questions when details are incomplete and can flag conflicting information.

This project combines structured university data with document retrieval and LLM-based reasoning to create a reliable academic guidance assistant that works in both text and voice-friendly workflows.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m advisor.ingest.build          # rebuild knowledge_base/ from the 4 source files (fails if validation fails)
python -m pytest tests                  # 10 tests, no credentials needed
cp .env.example .env                    # fill in Azure OpenAI endpoint, key, deployment names
python -m advisor.ingest.build          # re-run once .env is filled: adds dense embeddings (Bedrock Titan v2 or Azure; cached)
uvicorn advisor.server:app              # open http://127.0.0.1:8000
python eval/run_eval.py --judge         # 4-stage evaluation -> eval/results/
```

Without `.env` the web app runs in **preview mode**: it shows the passages retrieval would ground an answer in.

## Data: what is converted into what

| Source | Converted to | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `Semester_Spread_Structures_Sept_2026.xlsx`: 5 semester-spread grids | `offerings` (262 plan slots) and `options` (282 courses; paired cells such as `MATH401/COMP401` split, with per-course L-T-P taken from the title text) in SQLite | deterministic tools, course cards |
| same workbook: 5 `Struct_*` sheets | `baskets` (credit requirements), `structure_courses` (title-linked to codes) | credit structure, electives |
| `MinorCoursesforBTech_Students.xlsx`: 7 minors | `minors` (incl. TBA-credit placeholders), `minor_batches` (24-credit totals) | minor tool, cards |
| Student Handbook PDF (92 pp) | `knowledge_base/curated/handbook.md`: PyMuPDF plus reviewed patches (grade table image transcribed, formulas, mangled tables); 128 clause/page-aware chunks | hybrid retrieval |
| SOP PDF (6 pp, two-column) | `knowledge_base/curated/sop.md`, verbatim hand transcription with page anchors; 16 chunks | hybrid retrieval |
| derived | `terms` (batch × semester → months; batch year = admission year, Handbook §1.2), `issues` (135 detected conflicts/inconsistencies + 3 curated policy conflicts) | calendar tool, conflict flags |

Every record keeps provenance (`sheet` + cell range, or PDF/printed page). `knowledge_base/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` lists
the 42 build checks, including:

- every grid cell consumed
- each batch totals 180 credits
- basket sums vs Struct sheet
- each minor totals 24 credits
- prerequisite resolution
- ~20 hand-verified golden facts

`knowledge_base/LEGACY_PACKAGE_AUDIT.md` documents why the earlier `Knowledge_package/` was replaced. Its 2023 batch
had semesters 4–6 wrong or missing, and its records carry no batch field.

## Architecture

```
Excel ─┐ adapters → SourceUnits (IR + provenance) → validate → SQLite (exact facts) ─┐
PDF ───┘                                  └→ curated Markdown → chunks ┐          │
                                  SQLite → per-batch cards ────────────┴→ BM25 + dense + RRF
question (text | voice → Azure transcription) → LangGraph: agent (LLM + 11 tools) ⇄ tools → verify → answer + [S#] sources
```

- **Tools** (`advisor/tools.py`): pure Python over read-only SQLite:
  - `lookup_courses`, `course_details`, `semester_plan`, `credit_structure`, `minor_info`
  - `prerequisite_chain`, `academic_calendar`
  - `check_eligibility`: offered to the batch? prerequisites passed or failed? progression CGPA?
  - `list_data_issues`, `search_documents` (hybrid retrieval)
  - `run_sql`: SELECT-only, row-limited
- **Grounding**: the tools node numbers every source S1, S2, …. The `verify` node strips any citation no tool
  produced and computes flags for follow-up, conflict and insufficient information.
- **Adding a format** (DOCX/PPTX/HTML/CSV/OCR): write `extract(path) -> list[SourceUnit]` and register it in
  `advisor/ingest/__init__.py`. Re-ingestion is hash-tracked (`sources.json`), and embeddings are cached per chunk text.
- **Embeddings**: AWS Bedrock `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` (1024-d) when `BEDROCK_EMBED_MODEL` + AWS keys are set, else Azure OpenAI. The model id is stored with the vectors so queries always use the same model; the weak-evidence cut-off (cosine < 0.30) was calibrated on in-scope vs off-topic probes.
- **Deliberately not used**: Neo4j/GraphRAG/RAPTOR, a reranker, multi-agent orchestration. The corpus is about
  700 chunks, so an in-memory index and a prerequisite dict answer every query in the eval set.

## Evaluation

`eval/test_cases.json` has 30 cases:

- 8 factual
- 6 policy
- 6 eligibility with synthetic profiles
- 4 missing-information
- 4 conflict
- 1 ambiguous
- 1 out-of-scope

`eval/run_eval.py` runs each case through 4 stages: Basic LLM → structured prompt → RAG → RAG + tools + student data.

- **Rule-based labels**: correct / partial / hallucinated / incorrect, from required, forbidden and behaviour patterns per case. `--judge` adds an LLM grade against the expected outcome.
- **Metrics per stage**: accuracy, hallucination rate, eligibility correctness, incorrect recommendations, source correctness, missing-info and conflict handling, average and maximum latency.

Synthetic students live in `eval/profiles.json`. They contain no real names or IDs.
